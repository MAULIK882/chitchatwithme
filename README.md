# p2p-chat
Serverless peer to peer chat built on WebRTC.

[Demo chat](https://michal-wrzosek.github.io/p2p-chat/)

This is an example of how you can build p2p chat on WebRTC. Currently it works only in Firefox. As of writing this package (November 2019) Chrome STUN servers connection doesn't work and if 2 parties are in different networks, p2p connection will not work.
